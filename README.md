## Introduction

This is a PyTorch implementation of the identically named paper [(Kaliamoorthi et al., 2019)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1506.pdf). You can read Google's AI Blog about a related architecture [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/09/advancing-nlp-with-efficient-projection.html).

This is also a project for a university class of mine. As such, the initial implementation might not be fully optimal.
